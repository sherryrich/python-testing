# if number == 5:

# Challenge
# if the number is divisible by 3 = say "Fizz"
# if the number is divisible by 5 = say "Buzz"
# if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 = say "FizzBuzz"
# Otherwise say the original number

# num = 1

# if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
#     print("FizzBuzz")
# elif num % 3 == 0:
#     print("Fizz")
# elif num % 5 == 0:
#     print("Buzz")
# else:
#     print(num)
